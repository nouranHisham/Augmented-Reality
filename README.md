Computer Vision Assignment 2 part 1: Augmented reality with planar homographies

Problem Statement:

In this part of the assignment, we will be implementing an AR application step by step using planar homographies. 
We will first learn to find point correspondences between two images and use these to estimate the homography between them. Using this homography, we will then overlay images and finally implement our own AR application.

Further details can be found in the project's report.
